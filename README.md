This course is designed for students in the *Robotics and Intelligent Systems Engineering* program and aims to provide a solid foundation in the use and development of ROS 2 Humble applications.

# Instructions to launch the ROS 2 Packages

## 1. Running ROS 2 Examples

### Examples to Try

#### Talker-Listener

After installing `ros-humble-desktop` (and optionally `Terminator`), try the following:

* In **Terminal 1**, source the setup file and run a C++ talker:

  ```bash
  source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
  ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker
  ```

* In **Terminal 2**, source the setup file and run a Python listener:

  ```bash
  source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
  ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener
  ```

You should observe that the talker publishes messages and the listener confirms their reception.

#### Turtlesim: Publish and Move a Turtle

Another example is provided by the `turtlesim` package:

* In **Terminal 3**, run the turtlesim node:

  ```bash
  ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
  ```

* In **Terminal 4**, run the teleoperation node to control the turtle:

  ```bash
  ros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key
  ```

Use the arrow keys to move the turtle. This example demonstrates publishing velocity commands to control the simulated turtle.

## 2. Running ROS 2 Nodes

### Executing ROS 2 Publishers and Subscribers

#### Running the Python Publisher and Subscriber

After implementing and saving your Python nodes and updating `package.xml` and `setup.py` files, build your package and run the nodes. In two separate terminal sessions (or using the `Terminator` emulator), execute the following commands from the root of your workspace:

* **Terminal 1:** Build your package, source the setup file, and run the Python publisher node:

  ```bash
  colcon build --packages-select s2_py_pubsub
  source install/setup.bash
  ros2 run s2_py_pubsub publisher_exe
  ```

* **Terminal 2:** Source the setup file and run the Python subscriber node:

  ```bash
  source install/setup.bash
  ros2 run s2_py_pubsub subscriber_exe
  ```

You should observe that the `py_publisher` node sends a personalized message (e.g., displaying your name), and the `py_subscriber` node awaits the reception of the messages.

#### Running the C++ Publisher and Subscriber

After implementing and saving your C++ nodes and updating `package.xml` and `CMakeLists.txt` files, build your package and run the nodes. In two additional terminal sessions (or another two sessions in `Terminator`), execute the following commands from the root of your workspace:

* **Terminal 3:** Build your package, source the setup file, and run the C++ publisher node:

  ```bash
  colcon build --packages-select s2_cpp_pubsub
  source install/setup.bash
  ros2 run s2_cpp_pubsub publisher_exe
  ```

* **Terminal 4:** Source the setup file and run the C++ subscriber node:

  ```bash
  source install/setup.bash
  ros2 run s2_cpp_pubsub subscriber_exe
  ```

You should observe that the `py_publisher` node publishes your personalized message (e.g., displaying your name), and the `cpp_subscriber` node confirms its reception. Likewise, the `cpp_publisher` node publishes your other personalized message, and the `py_subscriber` node confirms its reception.

#### Visualizing the ROS Graph with `rqt_graph`

To ensure that your publisher and subscriber nodes are correctly connected, use the `rqt_graph` tool. In **Terminal 5**, execute the following command (no need to enter your workspace directory):

```bash
ros2 run rqt_graph rqt_graph
```

or simply:

```bash
rqt_graph
```

This visualization should show the topics connecting your publisher and subscriber nodes.

## 3. Running ROS 2 Services and Clients

### Executing ROS 2 Services and Clients

#### Running the Python Service and Client

After implementing and saving your Python nodes and updating the `package.xml` and `setup.py` files, build your package and run the nodes. In three separate terminal sessions (or using the `Terminator` emulator), execute the following commands from the root of your workspace:

* **Terminal 1:** Build your package, source the setup file, and launch the Python service node:

  ```bash
  colcon build --packages-select s3_py_srvcli
  source install/setup.bash
  ros2 run s3_py_srvcli server_exe
  ```

* **Terminal 2:** Source the setup file and run the Python client node:

  ```bash
  source install/setup.bash
  ros2 run s3_py_srvcli client_exe -11 -13
  ```

* **Terminal 3:** Send a service request directly from the command line:

  ```bash
  ros2 service call /py_add_two_ints_service example_interfaces/srv/AddTwoInts "{a: -2, b: -3}"
  ```

You should observe that the `py_server` node processes service requests from both the `py_client` node and the command-line client in Terminal 3.

#### Running the C++ Service and Client

After implementing and saving your C++ nodes and updating the `package.xml` and `CMakeLists.txt` files, build your package and run the nodes. In three additional terminal sessions (or three new sessions in `Terminator`), execute the following commands from the root of your workspace:

* **Terminal 4:** Build your package, source the setup file, and launch the C++ service node:

  ```bash
  colcon build --packages-select s3_cpp_srvcli
  source install/setup.bash
  ros2 run s3_cpp_srvcli server_exe
  ```

* **Terminal 5:** Source the setup file and run the C++ client node:

  ```bash
  source install/setup.bash
  ros2 run s3_cpp_srvcli client_exe 11 13
  ```

* **Terminal 6:** Send a service request directly from the command line:

  ```bash
  ros2 service call /cpp_add_two_ints_service example_interfaces/srv/AddTwoInts "{a: 2, b: 3}"
  ```

You should observe that the `cpp_server` node processes service requests from both the `cpp_client` node and the command-line client in Terminal 6.

#### Requesting a Service Using `rqt_service_caller`

Use the `rqt_service_caller` tool to send service requests to both the Python and C++ servers. In **Terminal 7**, run:

```bash
ros2 run rqt_service_caller rqt_service_caller
```

Then, request a service call for:

* `/py_add_two_ints_service` with the values `a: -5`, `b: -7`
* `/cpp_add_two_ints_service` with the values `a: 5`, `b: 7`

You should observe that the `py_server` and `cpp_server` nodes successfully process the service requests sent via `rqt_service_caller`.

## 4. ROS 2 Custom `.msg` and `.srv` Files

### Executing ROS 2 Publishers, Subscribers, Services, and Clients

After editing and saving your custom `.msg` and `.srv` files, and updating your C++ and Python nodes along with `CMakeLists.txt`, `setup.py`, and `package.xml`, build the packages:

```bash
colcon build --packages-select s4_custom_interface
colcon build --packages-select s4_cpp_apps
colcon build --packages-select s4_py_apps
```

Then, in **eight separate terminal sessions** (or using the `Terminator` emulator), source your ROS 2 workspace in each terminal and run the nodes as follows:

* **Terminal 1:** Run the Python publisher node:

  ```bash
  source install/setup.bash
  ros2 run s4_py_apps publisher_exe
  ```

* **Terminal 2:** Run the Python subscriber node:

  ```bash
  source install/setup.bash
  ros2 run s4_py_apps subscriber_exe
  ```

* **Terminal 3:** Run the Python server node:

  ```bash
  source install/setup.bash
  ros2 run s4_py_apps server_exe
  ```

* **Terminal 4:** Run the Python client node:

  ```bash
  source install/setup.bash
  ros2 run s4_py_apps client_exe -2 -3 -5
  ```

* **Terminal 5:** Run the C++ publisher node:

  ```bash
  source install/setup.bash
  ros2 run s4_cpp_apps publisher_exe
  ```

* **Terminal 6:** Run the C++ subscriber node:

  ```bash
  source install/setup.bash
  ros2 run s4_cpp_apps subscriber_exe
  ```

* **Terminal 7:** Run the C++ server node:

  ```bash
  source install/setup.bash
  ros2 run s4_cpp_apps server_exe
  ```

* **Terminal 8:** Run the C++ client node:

  ```bash
  source install/setup.bash
  ros2 run s4_cpp_apps client_exe 2 3 5
  ```

You should observe the following:

1. The `py_publisher` node publishes the custom `HardwareStatus` and `Sphere` messages.
2. The `py_subscriber` node receives the `HardwareStatus` message from the `cpp_publisher` and the `Sphere` message from the `py_publisher`.
3. The `py_server` node processes the service request from the `py_client` node.
4. The `cpp_publisher` node publishes the custom `HardwareStatus` and `Sphere` messages.
5. The `cpp_subscriber` node receives the `HardwareStatus` message from the `py_publisher` and the `Sphere` message from the `cpp_publisher`.
6. The `cpp_server` node processes the service request from the `cpp_client` node.

### Visualizing the ROS Graph with `rqt_graph`

To verify that all nodes are correctly connected, use the `rqt_graph` tool.

In **Terminal 9**, run:

```bash
ros2 run rqt_graph rqt_graph
```

or simply:

```bash
rqt_graph
```

This will display a graph of all publishers, subscribers, and services, confirming proper communication and node topology.

```bash
colcon build --packages-select s5_cpp_camera
colcon build --packages-select s5_cpp_camera_usr
colcon build --packages-select s5_py_camera
colcon build --packages-select s5_py_camera_usr
```

Then, in **three separate terminal sessions** (or using the `Terminator` emulator), source your ROS 2 workspace in each terminal and run the following:

* **Terminal 1:** Run either the C++ or Python image publisher node:

  ```bash
  source install/setup.bash
  ros2 run s5_cpp_camera camera_exe
  ```

* **Terminal 2:** Run the C++ image subscriber node:

  source install/setup.bash
  ros2 run s5_py_camera_usr camera_usr_exe
  ```

You should observe that:

1. The `cpp_camera` or `py_camera` node publishes the image message.
2. Both `cpp_camera_usr` and `py_camera_usr` nodes receive the image message.

---

### Visualizing the Image Topic with `rqt_image_view`

To verify that the publisher is correctly publishing the image topic, use:

```bash
ros2 run rqt_image_view rqt_image_view
```

This will display the image stream from either the C++ or Python image publisher node.

---

### Visualizing the ROS Graph with `rqt_graph`

To ensure that the publisher and subscriber nodes are correctly connected, run in a new terminal:

```bash
ros2 run rqt_graph rqt_graph
```

Or simply:

```bash
